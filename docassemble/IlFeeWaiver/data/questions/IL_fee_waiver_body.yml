  The judge will consider ${ your_or_their } income, assets, and expenses. Our prediction
  is based only on ${ your_or_their } income.
  
  For ${ your_or_their} household size, ${ your_or_their } monthly income needs to be at or below 
  ${ currency(poverty_scale_get_income_limit(household_size=household_size, multiplier=1.25)/12) }.
  
  You said that ${ your_or_their } income over the last month was 
  ${ currency(user_income_total) }.
  
  You said that ${ your_or_their} income over the last 12 months was 
  ${ currency(user_annual_total) } (${ currency(user_annual_total/12) }
  per month).
  
  The judge will also consider ${ your_or_their } total assets of ${ currency(user_asset_total) }
  and ${ your_or_their } total monthly expenses of ${ currency(user_expense_total) }. 
  
  #### A judge makes the final decision

  What else the judge will consider
content: |  
  The judge will look at all of the information that you provided on this
  form to decide if ${ you_or_they } qualify. For example, the judge will compare ${ your_or_their }
  assets and expenses. They will also read any additional explanation that you
  decide to provide.
  
  Some of ${ your_or_their } assets will not be counted. For example: the value of ${ your_or_their } car,
  up to $2,400, is not counted. A person can have up to $4,000 in other assets,
  such as bank accounts, that are not counted. The assets that are not
  counted are set by law: specifically, 
  [735 ILCS 5/12-901](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K12-1001)
  and [735 ILCS 5/12-1001](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K12-901).
  
  
  The judge may decide that ${ you_or_they } qualify for a partial redicution in court fees even if ${ you_or_they } do not qualify for a full waiver.
